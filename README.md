## About me
* I have been trying hard to learn new things and grow to be a better person each day.<br>
* My current goal is to grow as a junior web developer(hopefully fullstack).<br>

## My future goal
I like studying foreign languages, which affected me and made me interested in Natural Language Processing.<br>
I would like to try to dive into that field once I reach the level where I can finish my tasks as a web developer.<br>

## How I became interested in programming
I started to learn about programming when I was 13 years old because I wanted to make game modes that could make a game more fun and realized
that I had to do something called "programming" to do that. I became interested and started to learn programming.
