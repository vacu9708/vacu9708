## About me
I have been trying hard to learn new things and grow to be a better developer each day.<br>
My current goal is to grow as a decent backend developer(hopefully fullstack).<br>
I would like to try to study natural language processing once I reach the level where I can finish my tasks well as a web developer.<br>
