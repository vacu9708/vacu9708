### *There is no such thing as free happiness*
* ü•ÖWith this motto, I have been trying hard to learn new things and grow to be a better person each day.<br>
* My current goal is to grow as a good junior frontend engineer(hopefully fullstack).<br>
I like studying foreign languages, which affected me and made me interested in Natural Language Processing.
I want to study it hard to dive into that field once I reach the level where I can finish my tasks as a juior frontend engineer.

### How I became interested in programming
>I started to learn about programming when I was 13 years old because I wanted to make game modes that could make a game more fun and realized
>that I had to do something called "programming" to do that. I became interested and started to learn programming.
